- Verifiable Credits
    - A standadisation of muLearn's credit mechanism.
    - Make credits interoperable.
    - Credits from different entities should be standardised to a format so that entities like KTU, CUSAT etc can also use MuLearn Credits
    - Sunbird will help us implement VC. Or can use ready to use solutions from Ooru Digital.
    - These will ensure the credits accured can be validated for a reliable source of trust
