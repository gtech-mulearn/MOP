# Onix Beckn Success Definition

1. Onix Core : main onix specification, which can be used to setup a network including Adaptor, BAP, BPP and Gateway
2. Onix Extensions : extra add ons to the network like reputations and opendata ledger
3. Onix Dev : client side services/sdks which will help us easily connect to these networks.

Promod's suggestion is to create the sdks in a single language and with AI LLMs help create a module which can help in converting these libraries 


### GUI for Onix Core

1. Setup Env
2. Install onix and add network specific rule sets (Layer 2).
3. Test the installation through multiple scenerios by adding network 
4. Check the HeartBeat through the registry
5. Exeption handling (For a graceful shutdown)
