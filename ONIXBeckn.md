# Onix Beckn Success Definition

1. Onix Core
2. Onix Extensions
3. Onix Dev

If onix is running on our system, we will need client side services/sdks which will help us easily connect to these networks.

Promod's suggestion is to create the sdks in a single language and with AI LLMs help create a module which can help in converting these libraries 


### GUI

1. Setup Env
2. Install onix
3. Test the installation through multiple scenerios
4. Check the HeartBeat through the registry
5. Exeption handling (For a graceful shutdown)
